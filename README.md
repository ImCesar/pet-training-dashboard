# Pet Training Dashboard
This implements the [composable-dashboard](https://github.com/ImCesar/composable-dashboard) and shows how composition can be used to build custom profiles

## Running
In order to run this repo you need to install the [composable-dashboard](https://github.com/ImCesar/composable-dashboard). This is not hosted on npm and you have to host it yourself. I use [Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio) to do this.
